## NoteTD

I made this app in 2018 as a project for the course *'Web Design and Development'* at  *[World Academy](https://www.worldacademy.pt)*

This app is a typical to-do list in which we can add tasks and delete or edit them. When we finish the task, we can check it as done.

## Try out app
- Run ```npm install``` to install all the necess√°rio packages
- After, run ```npm start``` to try out the code
